# Self-Driving Car Course

Code for projects of ["The Complete Self-Driving Car Course - Applied Deep Learning"](https://www.udemy.com/course/applied-deep-learningtm-the-complete-self-driving-car-course/) on Udemy

## Overview

This repository contains code, resources, and solutions for various projects from the Udemy course. Each project demonstrates practical applications of deep learning in self-driving car development, covering tasks like lane detection, handwritten digit recognition, traffic sign recognition, and behavioral cloning for autonomous driving simulations.

## Files and Folders

1. **finding_lanes**
Contains code and resources for the task of detecting road lines in images or video.

2. **mnist_deep_learning.ipynb**
A Jupyter notebook solving the problem of handwritten digit recognition using the MNIST dataset and a simple multilayer perceptron model.

3. **traffic_sign_recognition.ipynb**
A Jupyter notebook demonstrating traffic sign recognition using a convolutional neural network.

4. **Behavioural_cloning.ipynb**
Jupyter notebook for data preprocessing, augmentation, and training a deep learning model (NVIDIA model) for autonomous car driving in simulation.

5. **drive.py**
Python script to run the behavioral cloning model within the Udacity car simulator, available at Udacity Self-Driving Car Simulator.
